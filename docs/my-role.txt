I helped translate Will's ambitious idea for a platform connecting at-risk youth with counselors and other resources into a technical proposal using  components such as chatbots for clients to engage with the system, and a graph database to suggest connections based on time and location. The proposed framework is a vue.js front end, and a Python flask backend which would use a neo4j graph database to handle the client and counselor data, as well as the states of a game engine which would guide the user through the steps needed to accomplish their goals, and score their award points at each stage.
